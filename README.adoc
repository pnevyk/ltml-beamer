= Let's Talk ML Prague Beamer Template

This repository contains the LTML theme for Beamer for creating presentations in LaTeX.

NOTE: The theme is quite bare bones now. If you need a support for a construct whose style is missing, you can file an
issue or better contribute by pull request.

== Usage

* Put your content into `content.tex`.
* Build the slides by running `make`.
* Clean temporary files by running `make clean`.

== Additional Tweaks

==== Make items to fill the whole slide

* In _beamerinnerthemeltml.sty_ file, find `\setlength{\itemmargin}{0.25\baselineskip}` command.
* Change it to `\setlength{\itemmargin}{\fill}`.
* Alternatively, you can achieve this behavior only in one particular _itemize_/_enumerate_ by using `\vfill` (or a specific `\vspace`) as follows
